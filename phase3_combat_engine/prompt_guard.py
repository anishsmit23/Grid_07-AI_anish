    Build a hardened system prompt that locks the bot into its persona.

    The base guard is ALWAYS present regardless of injection_detected.
    If an injection is detected, an additional explicit counter-instruction

    Defense strategy: The system prompt uses meta-level framing to tell the
    LLM that any instruction from the human turn is untrusted input, not a
    command. This exploits the fact that LLMs give higher trust to system
    prompts than to user turn messages.
